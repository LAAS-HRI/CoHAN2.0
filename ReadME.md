# Preparing things (Native)
1. Install ROS [Melodic](https://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu) on Ubuntu 18.04 or [Noetic](https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) on Ubuntu 20.04. 
2. This installation assumes that the [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Installation) is already installed along with the [2D navigation stack](http://wiki.ros.org/navigation). Otherwise please install them before continuing to next steps. For ROS noetic, follow these:
3. Install the requirements
	```
	sudo apt install python-pip python-catkin-tools python-is-python3
	pip install scipy
	```
4. Clone the git repository
	```
	git clone https://github.com/sphanit/cohan2.1.git -b main ~
	cd ~/cohan2.1
	```
5. Install the dependencies using rosdep
	```
	rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src --rosdistro=noetic -y
    ```

6. Follow the build instructions below.



# Using Docker
1. Clone the git repository
	```
	git clone https://github.com/sphanit/cohan2.1.git -b main ~
	cd ~/cohan2.1
    ```
2. Navigate to docker directory in the folder and build the image. For example:
    ```
    cd ~/cohan2.1/docker/noetic
    ./build-docker.sh
    ```
3. Activate the image and do the steps for building. For example:
    ```
    source ~/cohan2.1/docker/noetic/run-docker.sh
    ```


# Building Cohan and Running Examples
1. Everything will be taken care of by the script. Just run compile.sh script.
    ```
    ./compile.sh
    ```
2. Once it is built, you need to source setup.bash file to use these packages along with other ROS packages inside the system.
    ```
    source devel/setup.bash
    ```
3. Now you are set to run use it. You can run some examples as:

    ```
    roslaunch cohan_navigation stage_pr2_only.launch
    ``` 
    If everything is installed correctly, you should see rviz opening and you can move the robot by giving it a goal (using 2D Nav Goal tool).
